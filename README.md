# Avocado Website
My HTML webpage assignment is a website about avocados.

## Commit to use
f1581ee0f71b7e4e272f0531aa12f333c4889a04 (it's called like "Image alts, fixed bug, added README")

## Advanced HTML
I have a navbar, some layout work, and a button to toggle dark and light mode on my website, the last of which is the most advanced feature of my page.

## Noted Issue
The navbar doesn't highlight exactly on the center of the buttons when you hover over it when using Safari on my computer. It does work with Firefox and Chrome, which I believe is what matters (?); I think it's a bit of a fluke.

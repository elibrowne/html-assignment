# Avocado Website
My HTML webpage assignment is a website about avocados.

## Final project
The latest commit is probably the one that you should use.<br/>
1. Design strategy was a grid; each cell has a different type of information. Bigger cells on the bottom are wider and have more detailed information than the little blurbs of info on the top. Images are used to separate the facts and to make the website more digestible.
2. Background is white. Neighboring cells have different colors to differentiate between different cells. Color scheme was trying to emulate avocado-y colors (green and yellow).
3. Bootstrap was used to format the grids. 
4. There is no call to action.
5. I tried to use good coding habits. I'm sorry if I failed.
6. I added the nutrition information page -- it's accesible through the "learn more" button. It's a bit tucked away, so only someone interested in the nutrition facts would be very prone to seeing it. On the page, it has a similar layout (but different images) and a very easy-to-see button to go home.
7. I've checked every size that my browser window goes to, and on every one of them, the webpage is readable and text stays inside of the boxes.

## Commit to use for HTML
f1581ee0f71b7e4e272f0531aa12f333c4889a04 (it's called like "Image alts, fixed bug, added README")

## Commit to use for CSS
33fb6c2 (it's called "Edited README a bit")

## Commit to use for Bootstrap
b8c0769 (it's called like "Added alert, finished five classes"). **Note:** it is on a new branch called "bootstrap"; it is **not** on the master branch (sorry if that makes things harder! I can merge them if you'd like, but I wanted to separate the two websites)

## Advanced HTML
I have a navbar, some layout work, and a button to toggle dark and light mode on my website, the last of which is the most advanced feature of my page.

## Noted Issue
The navbar on the non-Bootstrap version doesn't highlight exactly on the center of the buttons when you hover over it when using Safari on my computer. It does work with Firefox and Chrome, which I believe is what matters (?); I think it's a bit of a fluke.

## Requirements Checklist (for me to keep track of everything)<br/>
*Unordered list:* recipe ideas<br/>
*Ordered list:* recipe instructions<br/>
*Table with tr, th and td elements:* nutrition facts<br/>
*Link to an external website out in the wider world:* links to AllRecipes<br/>
*Internal link to an anchor on the page:* navbar links to #art, #images, etc<br/>
*Image:* two images in the image section<br/>
*iframe:* poem "Eating the Avocado"<br/>
*Some kind of Unicode character:* a with macron in Nahuatl word, moon for the toggle view button<br/>

*Twenty tags:* ul, li, a, button, h1, p, h2, strong, em, q, table, tr, th, td, ol, hr, iframe, img, address, br = 20<br/>
Not including basics like html, script, style, head, body, meta, etc.

## CSS Requirements (for me so I don't stress haha)<br/>
*External style sheet:* style.css<br/>
*20 different CSS style attributes:* there are 92 lines of CSS and 21 unique style attributes (but I used many style attributes multiple times but in different ways throughout the website).<br/>
*Class:* Navbar has a bunch of classes<br/>
*ID:* id="hg" in the span to make the 100g italics and green<br/>
*No internal style sheet:* unless I am blind, there isn't one :)<br/>
*CSS box model:* I have examples of padding in my navbar and I used image columns. I used margin in the address. I struggled greatly with adding the border because it is not attractive whatsoever but it is around an image.

## Bootstrap Requirements Checklist
*Bootstrap rows/columns:* under the recipes h2, three different tables (large+ = 4 columns, small+ = 2 columns, tiny = 1 column)<br/>
*Navbar:* see top of website<br/>
*Navbar fancy item:* collapsible<br/>
*Five additional classes:* jumbotron (see nutrition), table (see nutrition), carousel (see images), badge (see "Recipes" h2), alert (see "Watch out!" below recipes)

# Avocado Website
My HTML webpage assignment is a website about avocados.

## Commit to use for HTML
f1581ee0f71b7e4e272f0531aa12f333c4889a04 (it's called like "Image alts, fixed bug, added README")

## Commit to use for CSS
33fb6c2 (it's called "Edited README a bit")

## Commit to use for Bootstrap
b8c0769 (it's called like "Added alert, finished five classes"). **Note:** it is on a new branch called "bootstrap"; it is **not** on the master branch (sorry if that makes things harder! I can merge them if you'd like, but I wanted to separate the two websites)

## Advanced HTML
I have a navbar, some layout work, and a button to toggle dark and light mode on my website, the last of which is the most advanced feature of my page.

## Noted Issue
The navbar on the non-Bootstrap version doesn't highlight exactly on the center of the buttons when you hover over it when using Safari on my computer. It does work with Firefox and Chrome, which I believe is what matters (?); I think it's a bit of a fluke.

## Requirements Checklist (for me to keep track of everything)<br/>
*Unordered list:* recipe ideas<br/>
*Ordered list:* recipe instructions<br/>
*Table with tr, th and td elements:* nutrition facts<br/>
*Link to an external website out in the wider world:* links to AllRecipes<br/>
*Internal link to an anchor on the page:* navbar links to #art, #images, etc<br/>
*Image:* two images in the image section<br/>
*iframe:* poem "Eating the Avocado"<br/>
*Some kind of Unicode character:* a with macron in Nahuatl word, moon for the toggle view button<br/>

*Twenty tags:* ul, li, a, button, h1, p, h2, strong, em, q, table, tr, th, td, ol, hr, iframe, img, address, br = 20<br/>
Not including basics like html, script, style, head, body, meta, etc.

## CSS Requirements (for me so I don't stress haha)<br/>
*External style sheet:* style.css<br/>
*20 different CSS style attributes:* there are 92 lines of CSS and 21 unique style attributes (but I used many style attributes multiple times but in different ways throughout the website).<br/>
*Class:* Navbar has a bunch of classes<br/>
*ID:* id="hg" in the span to make the 100g italics and green<br/>
*No internal style sheet:* unless I am blind, there isn't one :)<br/>
*CSS box model:* I have examples of padding in my navbar and I used image columns. I used margin in the address. I struggled greatly with adding the border because it is not attractive whatsoever but it is around an image.

## Bootstrap Requirements Checklist
*Bootstrap rows/columns:* under the recipes h2, three different tables (large+ = 4 columns, small+ = 2 columns, tiny = 1 column)<br/>
*Navbar:* see top of website<br/>
*Navbar fancy item:* collapsible<br/>
*Five additional classes:* jumbotron (see nutrition), table (see nutrition), carousel (see images), badge (see "Recipes" h2), alert (see "Watch out!" below recipes)
